[*] streams :

#  0  -  stdin   →  Takes input (usually from keyboard)
#  1  -  stdout  →  Shows normal output (like command results)
#  2  -  stderr  →  Shows error messages (like "file not found")

Using this streams

$ ls -l 1> filename      		# using standard output  this will work as it is valid , ls -l will list long format and redirect it using 
$ cat pancackes 2> filename      	# since the file does not actually exist it will redirect the output to the file , beacuse file not found an output will be created that's why 
$ cat < filename  			# takes input from file instead of keyboard
$ cat 0< filename

Example :

$ wc -l << EOF
> this is agney 
> how may i help you ?
> please make it quick
> we are running out of time
> ronaldo is the goat
> messi is also goat
> neymar is also a magician
> EOF

Output :

[10:55] agn3y@localhost [~/experimental]  $ wc -l << EOL
> this is agney
> how may i help you
> please make it quick
> we are running out of time
> ronaldo is goat
> messi is also goat
> neymar is also a magician 
> EOL
