[*] streams :

#  0  -  stdin   →  Takes input (usually from keyboard)
#  1  -  stdout  →  Shows normal output (like command results)
#  2  -  stderr  →  Shows error messages (like "file not found")

Using this streams

$ ls -l 1> filename      		# using standard output  this will work as it is valid , ls -l will list long format and redirect it using 
$ cat pancackes 2> filename      	# since the file does not actually exist it will redirect the output to the file , beacuse file not found an output will be created that's why 
$ cat < filename  			# takes input from file instead of keyboard
$ cat 0< filename
