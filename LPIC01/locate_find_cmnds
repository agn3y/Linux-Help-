- To install locate command we can use 
$ sudo dnf install epel-release -y
$ sudo dnf install mlocate -y

- Locate command works on database one of the reason which makes it quick.
- It is located at /var/lib/mlocate/mlocate.db

- To update this database, we can use
$ sudo updatedb

$ locate 		# to locate file or directory
$ time locate *.py	# locate py files and also tell how much time does it took

- Directories where lot of data read and write happens will not counted in bydefault such as tmp and var 
- If we want to remove above given restriction we need to perform certain step:
- Go to /etc and look for [" updatedb.conf" ]. In this file there are two things: 
[1] PRUNEPATHS			# directories which are listed in this path will be ignored while updating the database
[2] PRUNEFS				# directories will be updated when we update the database
	

[#]	find :

$ find / -name *.py	# does look forpy in root directory
