When we create jobs, they might consume more memory than expected, which can break the system. To prevent a process from harming the system, we can send signals such as kill, hibernate, etc.

In such cases we can use signals to manage such processes

$ kill -l          # Lists all available signals

bydefault kill uses 15 as default switch, we can also write above give command as

$ kill -"SIGNANAME"	PID		# Sends signals "NAME"
$ kill -15 PID     			# Sends signal 15 (SIGTERM) — a polite request to stop
$ kill -9  PID     			# Sends signal  9 (SIGKILL) — forcefully stops the process


{*} killsll :

# need to be carefull while using this command

$ killall -l 		# list all possible signals
