Expressing Context (For better understanding) :

dr-xr-xr-- => d | r-x | r-x | r--

to add/remove any permission from group 

$sudo chmod g(+w/-w) "file/directory name"

to apply process on everyone we can use

$sudo chmod a(+w/-w) "file/directory name"

Example:

$chmod ugo+e "file name"


Note: 

Beacuse we can do operation on or in directory such as navigating thats why there is execute permission there

=========================
Permission using Numerics
=========================

we can do same this which we used in example using numerics

$chmod 444 filename
